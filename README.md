# Graph-Viewer
Qt Application for visualizing graphs and algorithms pertaining to graphs

## To-Be-Implemented

Everything. When I have time. Which is never. But it's the thought that counts

### Generic Features

* Step-by-step iteration of algorithms. Preferably with tables of intermediate data visible.
* Control over algorithm steps. Start/Stop buttons, Iteration speed. Next/Previous buttons.
* READMEs on all algorithms and their implementation. Will have to somehow view LateX or HTML on application
* Ability to detect types of graphs (Undirected, Acyclic, DAG, etc). Necessary for choosing which algorithms can run

### Algorithms

* Shortest Path
  * Known
    * Dijkstra's
    * Bellman-Ford
    * Floyd-Warshall
  * Unknown
    * Johnson's
* Minimum Spanning Tree
  * Known
  	* Kruskal's
  	* Prim's
* Search/Sort
  * Known
  	* Depth First Search
  	* Breadth First Search
  	* Topological Sort
* Graph Detection
  * Acyclic
  * Tree Structure
  * Planar
* Undefined because I don't know how to implement these/what they are
  * Vertex Cover
  * Graph Coloring


Will be attempting to implement other graph algorithms later on, probably choosing from this [site](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/graph-data-structure-and-algorithms/) and this [site](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Graph_algorithms)
